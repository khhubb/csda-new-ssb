Validation logic and flow of control:


bool CCastStringValidator::Validate(vector<CCastStringHeat>& heats,
				    CCastString* pCastString,
				    CCasterScen* pCasterScen,
				    CSuperScen* pSuperScen) 

 -- validate cond and disp codes: slab thickness, etc.

 -- Validate340080

 -- CheckCondAndDispCodeRelationships

## finding the caster

   int caster = m_pCastString->Id().Caster();  // 3 and 4, each single strand (like caster 2)

## new code:


Introduced a few goodies in Caster.h/.cpp to avoid magic constants.  
You'll new see things like

    bool m_casterSeen[Caster::CasterArrayLen];

    m_casterSeen[Caster::C4]

    for ( int i=Caster::FirstCaster; i<= Caster::LastCaster;; ++i )
       m_casterScen[i] ...


    assert (Caster::IsValidCasterValue(casterNum));

    if ( Caster::CasterNumStrands[caster] == 2 ) 
      ...

## Questions to KH


MiscConstants:
We have turnaround times of 75 and 90 minutes on Casters 2 and 3.
And 0 on Caster 1.
What are values of turnaround time for Casters 4,5?

Length CMiscConstants::m_casterSlabLengthMaxes[4] = { 0, 452, 452, 431 };
What are values for casters 4,5?


PerUserDefaultValues:
Need values for
Caster4HeatSizeMin
Caster4HeatSizeAim
Caster4HeatSizeMax
Caster5HeatSizeMin
Caster5HeatSizeAim
Caster5HeatSizeMax

PPGHeatSizes:
There is an editing screen for the caster 1,2,3 heat size min/aim/max that I will add to.
On that dialog, the values for casters 2,3 are tied to be identical.
Is there any similar tying of values for 4 and 5?

----
Some of this data may be in the rules you gave us for the new casters.

First, I need to add columns to the table PerUserDefaultValues.
It has one row, many columns. 
Rather stupid, probably me.

We'll need to add columns for the two new casters.  I'll need values.  Here is what's in there now:




Caster1HeatSizeMin	
Caster1HeatSizeAim	
Caster1HeatSizeMax	
Caster2HeatSizeMin	
Caster2HeatSizeAim	
Caster2HeatSizeMax	
Caster3HeatSizeMin	
Caster3HeatSizeAim	
Caster3HeatSizeMax


	240	245	273	205	210	230	205	210	230


I'll be adding the obvious min/aim/max for 4 and 5.

Values?

---------------------

the file I sent you is now in caster-convert-docs/caster-usage.txt.
I'll be updating it as I go along.
