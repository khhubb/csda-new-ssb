Questions on Scheduling Rules:

General question:

Are the slit-type codes used for the other casters also used for these new casters?
In other words, are we adding new rules or replacing old rules with new ones?

The codes for the other casters are 1-character: for example, 'D', 'H', 'T'.
The codes for the new casters are at least 2-character and sometimes 3-character: for example, "7D", "8H", "25T"

To repeat: Are we applying the _old_ codes and the _new_ codes, or just the new ones?

Specific questions on the rules from the the "Scheduling Rules" document for the 3SP casters

1.1.1: This rule refers to 7D, 6D, and 8H -- all of which are 2-character MORD_SMK_COND_WEST codes

       The rule also refers to 25T, which is not a MORD_SMK_COND_WEST looks like the last 3 characters
       of the 5-character MORD_SMK_SPEC_WEST code.

       ### Is this correct?

1.1.7: This rule applies to "Line pipe" scheduling. How is line pipe scheduling determined?
