Questions:

MiscConstants:
We have turnaround times of 75 and 90 minutes on Casters 2 and 3.
And 0 on Caster 1.
What are values of turnaround time for Casters 4,5?

Length CMiscConstants::m_casterSlabLengthMaxes[4] = { 0, 452, 452, 431 };
What are values for casters 4,5?


PerUserDefaultValues:
Need values for
Caster4HeatSizeMin
Caster4HeatSizeAim
Caster4HeatSizeMax
Caster5HeatSizeMin
Caster5HeatSizeAim
Caster5HeatSizeMax

PPGHeatSizes:
There is an editing screen for the caster 1,2,3 heat size min/aim/max that I will add to.
On that dialog, the values for casters 2,3 are tied to be identical.
Is there any similar tying of values for 4 and 5?


What are the formulas for calculating cast times on casters 4,5?

How are specs associated with casters?
Specs are in the following tables:

	HeatSpecCrossApp -- 
		maps specs to specs, caster not involved in the table.
		However, caster is involved in the lookup ti check certain characters in the spec:
		
				// filter for specs suitable for this caster
			  
				if ( dig4 == '0'
					 ||
					 ( caster == 1 && ( dig4 == '4' || dig4 == '7' ) )
					 ||
					 ( caster != 1 && ( dig4 == '2' ) ) )			
		
		Is this correct for casters 4,5?
		
	SteelSpecCrossAppSet
		caster not involved
		
	SpecChemRangePreset
		caster not involved
		
	SpecDPAChemsSet
	SpecDPASet
		Both have a field CString	m_CASTER_INDICATOR;
			m_forCaster[1] = (dpaSpec.m_CASTER_INDICATOR.Find('1') != -1);
			m_forCaster[2] = (dpaSpec.m_CASTER_INDICATOR.Find('2') != -1);
			m_forCaster[3] = (dpaSpec.m_CASTER_INDICATOR.Find('3') != -1);
			m_isBloomSpec  = (dpaSpec.m_CASTER_INDICATOR.Find('B') != -1);
			
		Will the same be true for Casters 4,5?	
		
		
	In CSpecMgr::FindSpecMaybe
		When looking up spec info given the spec name, we first look it up directly.
		If not found, we plae with the first digit of the second group:
			//  XXX-0X-XX ==>  XXX-2X-XX    if caster == 2 or 3
			//  XXX-0X-XX ==>  XXX-4X-XX     if caster == 1
			//  XXX-0X-XX ==>  XXX-7X-XX     if caster == 1
		Do any of these transformations apply to casters 4,5?  Other transformations?
		
		At the moment, calls to FindSpecMaybe from CSpecMgr::InitializeDPAChems has a strange caster calculation:
		
				//at the moment, having only caster == 2 or not has the desired effect.
				int caster;
				if ( chemSet.m_CASTER_INDICATOR.Find('1') != -1 )
					caster = 1;
				else 
					caster = 2;

				CSpec* pSpec = FindSpecMaybe(spec,caster);
				
				This is true only because we care about caster 1 vs caster 2.  We are checking for "on 1" vs "not on 1" because this triggers code in FindSpecMaybe.
				What do we do with the new casters?

Orders:

	We determine which caster an order is for by looking at table unappliedorders, fields
			SM_PLAN_SLAB_UNIT_CD
			SM_PLAN_FACL_PREF_1_CD
			SM_PLAN_FACL_PREF_2_CD
			SM_PLAN_FACL_PREF_3_CD
	These will contain values "4" and "5"  (they are strings) to indicate orders for those casters?
