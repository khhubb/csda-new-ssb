Questions:

MiscConstants:
We have turnaround times of 75 and 90 minutes on Casters 2 and 3.
And 0 on Caster 1.
What are values of turnaround time for Casters 4,5?

Length CMiscConstants::m_casterSlabLengthMaxes[4] = { 0, 452, 452, 431 };
What are values for casters 4,5?


PerUserDefaultValues:
Need values for
Caster4HeatSizeMin
Caster4HeatSizeAim
Caster4HeatSizeMax
Caster5HeatSizeMin
Caster5HeatSizeAim
Caster5HeatSizeMax

PPGHeatSizes:
There is an editing screen for the caster 1,2,3 heat size min/aim/max that I will add to.
On that dialog, the values for casters 2,3 are tied to be identical.
Is there any similar tying of values for 4 and 5?
